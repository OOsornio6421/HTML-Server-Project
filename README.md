# HTML-Server-Project

I was not able to add the complete Visual Studio file so this project is just to showcase language proficiency.
This project was made to design a HTTP Server that could remotely control a crane.
The project involves both Front-End (HTML, CSS, Java) and Back-End (C) files used to develop the project.
I was just a middle man and ended up doing a lot of the finnicking but never saw the completed version.
